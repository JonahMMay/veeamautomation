# VSPC_Tenant_Resources

Collect information on each tenant in VSPC.

# Description

This script provides an easy way of compiling backup information such as a tenant's VBR server, repository names, repository hosts, and consumption. This information is then saved to a CSV file where it can be loaded and filtered, for easily identifying customers affected by specific component outages.

# Usage

Update the token on line 27 with a valid API key and the base URL on line 32 with the VSPC server name.
